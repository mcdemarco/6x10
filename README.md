# 6x10

6x10 is a Javascript implementation of my larger variant of Russ's 3x10 (along with 3x10 itself), which reimplements (in the non-programming sense) Friedemann Friese's 5x15, using the Decktet.

This implementation is based on my implementation of Myrmex, and inspired by an HTML implementation of 5x15 by BGG user garfieldcut.  You can play it at [my website](http://mcdemarco.net/games/decktet/6x10/).

## Credits
            
The Decktet card system was created by P.D. Magnus. The card images and card backs used here were released under a Creative Commons License by P.D. Magnus.  The optional black moons are a cosmetic change I made for Myrmex to increase legibility on small screens.  The handwriting font is Fortune Letters, also by P.D. Magnus.  

The background texture is "Skulls" by Adam, from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/skulls/).

Please visit the [Decktet web site](http://www.decktet.com/)
to find out more about the Decktet and to get your own deck.  (Note that a double deck is required to play 6x10.)
